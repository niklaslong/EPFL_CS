 VARIABLE DECLARATION:
 
    type identifier;
 
 TYPES:
 
    int - integer
    double - float
    char - character, uses '' (single quote)
    void - no storage, mostly used as a function return type
    bool - boolean value, either true or false
 
    std::string - covered lower
    std::array - covered lower - static, size known at compile time, stored on stack
    std::vector - covered lower - dynamic, size not known at compile time, stored on heap
 
 BEST PRACTICES:
 
    Declare variables as close to their place of use as possible.
    Declare variables with initial values when possible.
    Make variables constant where possible.
